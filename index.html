        <p>Hey guys, well I'm almost at the end of my first solo travel trip and I'd thought I'd share my experience with you seeing I've got no one else to talk about it with as I'm solo haha! <br><br>

            I've been travelling round the USA and Canada solo for about 4 weeks now (I started with family but they had to leave). I'm a female at 21, this is the first time I've been away from home and had to be independent which seems pretty nerve wracking but I ended up adapting so quickly to it as I had no other choice. I've always been a loner, introvert type, so I'm completely fine with my own company. A lot of people were surprised when I said I was travelling alone, as ive always been such a shy and petite girl so it's great just to show them what I can do, and its absolutely trebled my confidence! <br><br>
            
            I stayed in hostels, where I learnt it was so easy to meet new people. At the start of my trip I was really eager to meet new people, but now I'm at the end of my trip, I couldn't care less? It's like I've got so used to being on my own. Please tell me I'm not the only one that feels this way because I feel so antisocial? <br><br>
            
            Travelling solo as a female definitely has its pros and con's. But if I had the choice I still would of travelled solo as its helped improve my confidence so much. The downsides are carrying your heavy luggage, and night time. Night time sucks if you're on your own because its too dangerous to be outside, so you're just sat alone in the hostel by 7pm!</p>
